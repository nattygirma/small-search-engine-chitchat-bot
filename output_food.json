The term also extends to firmly-cooked vegetables.\nIn contemporary Italian cooking, it is considered to be the ideal consistency for pasta and involves a brief cooking time. Molto al dente is the Italian term for slightly undercooked pasta. \nWhen cooking commercial pasta, the al dente phase occurs right before the white of the pasta center disappears.\nUndercooking pasta is used in the first round of cooking when a pasta dish is going to be cooked twice.",

Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now popular in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream is sometimes used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, salmon or broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main course.\nThe dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, a Roman restaurateur who is credited with its invention and popularisation. Di Lelio's elaborate tableside service was an integral part of the recipe's success. Fettuccine Alfredo is a variant of standard Italian fettuccine al burro ('fettuccine with butter') or pasta burro e parmigiano ('pasta with butter and Parmesan cheese'). It is a kind of pasta in bianco, that is, without added sauce. Italian recipes do not include cream and are not topped with other ingredients, nor is the dish generally called \"Alfredo\" in Italy.",

Despite its name, it has only a very distant relation to the chop suey of Chinese and American Chinese cuisine.\nThough this comfort food is influenced by Italian-American cuisine as well as older New England quick and practical meals like the \"potato bargain\" and \"necessity mess,\" it is known as \"American chop suey\" both because it is a sometimes-haphazard hodgepodge of meat, vegetables and Italian seasonings, and because it once used rice, a base ingredient in Chinese cuisine, instead of pasta.\nStandard American chop suey consists of elbow macaroni and bits of cooked ground beef with saut\u00e9ed onions in a thick tomato-based sauce. The dish can be served on a plate or in a bowl, usually accompanied by bread and often Worcestershire sauce. \n\n",

Starting from the Middle Ages the permanent residence of the nobility in the region gradually declined, which caused the disappearance of their noble cuisine over time. As the common people suffered from poverty, their culinary tradition adapted to use cheap and simple foods. Bread, vegetables and pasta have the leading role in the cuisine. Fruits, fish and wine are consumed frequently as well, but meat plays a minor role. The food of Apulia is known as a prime example of cucina povera or 'cuisine of the poor', characterizing its simplicity rather than its quality. Moreover, the simple dishes allow the quality of their local and seasonal ingredients to take center stage.",
